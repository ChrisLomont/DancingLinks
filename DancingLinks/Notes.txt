Matrix 0s and 1s, 
columns represent 'items'
rows represent 'options'
Some items 'primary' and some 'secondary'
Every option contains at least one primary item
Problem is to find options so that 
 1) exactly 1 item for primary, 
 2) at most 1 for secondary

Input on stdin (TODO)
one line with space separated items 
each item has symbolic name (Knuth limits to 8 chars)
any non-blank ASCII except : and pipe '|' (0x7c)
all primary items, then '|' , then all secondary

then one option per line, option is list of item names

comment lines start with '|', ignored
